# Library Management System

A **console-based Python application** to manage a library's books, authors, and borrowing records.  
This project demonstrates **Python OOP principles**, **file I/O**, **data persistence**, and **basic library operations**.

---

- **List All Books** - View complete library inventory
- **Delete Books** - Remove books from the system

### Borrowing System
- **Borrow Books** - Check out books with automatic availability checking
- **Return Books** - Return borrowed books and update records

## Data Persistence

### File Storage
All data is stored in JSON format in the `data/` folder:

- **books.json** - Stores book inventory
  ```json
  {
    "isbn": {
      "title": "Book Title",
      "author": "Author Name",
      "isbn": "978-XXXXXXXXX",
      "category": "Fiction",
      "year": 2024,
      "total_copies": 5,
      "available_copies": 3
    }
  }
  ```

- **authors.json** - Stores author information
  ```json
  {
    "author_id": {
      "name": "Author Name",
      "books": ["isbn1", "isbn2"]
    }
  }
  ```

- **borrow.json** - Stores borrowing records
  ```json
  {
    "borrow_id": {
      "isbn": "978-XXXXXXXXX",
      "borrower": "John Doe",
      "borrow_date": "2024-11-24",
      "return_date": null,
      "due_date": "2024-12-08"
    }
  }
  ```

### Data Integrity
- Data persists between program runs
- Automatic backup on critical operations (optional)
- Validation checks prevent data corruption

---

## Features in Detail

### Dynamic Copy Tracking
- System automatically tracks total and available copies
- Prevents borrowing when no copies are available
- Updates counts in real-time during borrow/return operations

### Overdue Detection
- Calculates days overdue based on due date
- Highlights overdue borrowings in red (if terminal supports colors)
- Sends reminders for overdue books (optional feature)

### Search Capabilities
- Case-insensitive search
- Partial matching for titles and authors
- Multiple filter criteria can be combined

---

## Technical Details

### OOP Structure
```
LibraryResource (Base Class)
    ├── Book
    ├── Author
    └── Borrow

FileIO (Utility Class)
    ├── read_json()
    ├── write_json()
    └── backup_data()

Utils (Helper Functions)
    ├── search_books()
    ├── filter_books()
    ├── check_availability()
    └── calculate_overdue()
```

### Key Classes

**Book Class**
```python
class Book(LibraryResource):
    def __init__(self, title, author, isbn, category, year, copies):
        # Book initialization
    
    def borrow(self):
        # Decrease available copies
    
    def return_book(self):
        # Increase available copies
```

**Borrow Class**
```python
class Borrow:
    def __init__(self, isbn, borrower, borrow_date, due_date):
        # Borrow record initialization
    
    def is_overdue(self):
        # Check if book is overdue
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please follow these guidelines:

### Code Standards
- Follow Python 3.11+ standards
- Maintain OOP structure (LibraryResource → Book/Borrow/Author)
- Use `file_io.py` for all JSON read/write operations
- Add docstrings to all classes and functions
- Follow PEP 8 style guide

### Contribution Process
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`)

- [ ] Fine calculation for overdue books
- [ ] Email notifications for due dates
- [ ] Book reservation system
- [ ] Multi-library support
- [ ] Web interface using Flask/Django
- [ ] Database integration (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Book rating and review system
- [ ] Export reports to PDF/Excel

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Data files not found
```
Solution: Ensure data/ folder exists with books.json, authors.json, and borrow.json
```

**Issue**: Permission denied when writing files
```
Solution: Check folder permissions or run with appropriate privileges
```

**Issue**: Invalid JSON format
```
Solution: Delete corrupted JSON file and restart (backup files recommended)
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

Manual testing checklist:
- [ ] Add book successfully
- [ ] Borrow book with available copies
- [ ] Prevent borrowing when no copies available
- [ ] Return book and update records
- [ ] Search functionality works correctly
- [ ] Filter displays correct results
- [ ] Data persists after program restart
